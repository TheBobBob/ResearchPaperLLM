#Summary

The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is a publicly available dataset that addresses the limitations of existing MRI repositories in glioblastoma research. The dataset features multiparametric MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. By providing expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions, the dataset enables the development of algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes through personalized treatments.


#Background and Significance

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts. The integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based algorithms has improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial data source in this domain, with public repositories like TCIA and BraTS providing valuable datasets for research.

However, these resources have limitations, focusing primarily on preoperative studies with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited expert annotations. To address these constraints, the Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is introduced, featuring multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis.

The significance of this study lies in its ability to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. By publicly disseminating this dataset, researchers can develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans. This has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance patient outcomes, and contribute to the development of personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.


#Methods

• **Patient population**: The study included 40 patients with WHO grade 4 astrocytoma who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022, meeting specific inclusion criteria.

• **Clinical, Pathological, and Imaging Data**: Clinical and pathological information was obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and details of chemotherapy and radiotherapy received.

• **Image Preprocessing**:
	+ Images were retrieved in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format.
	+ Converted to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using dicom2niix tool version v1.0.20220720.
	+ Registered T1ce scans to SRI24 anatomical atlas space using FLIRT (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool).
	+ Registered other MRI series (T1w, T2w, FLAIR, and ADC maps) to the transformed T1ce scan.
	+ Extracted brain from all co-registered scans using Synthstrip deep learning tool included in FreeSurfer v7.3.0.
	+ Performed intensity Z-scoring normalization using Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk) v1.9.0.

• **Tumor Subregions Segmentations**:
	+ Used preprocessed images as input for generating computer-aided segmentations using Deep-Medic.
	+ Obtained three labels: 1 - necrosis, 2 - peritumoral signal alteration (including edema and non-enhancing tumor), and 3 - enhancing tumor.
	+ Manually corrected segmentations by two expert neurosurgeons specializing in neuroimaging.


**#Results**

The study population consisted of 40 patients with glioblastomas, with an average age of 63 ± 9 years and a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy.

Key findings:

• **Demographics**: 70% of patients were men, and 30% were women; median age was 63 years.
• **IDH status**: 10% of patients had IDH-mutated glioblastomas, while 90% were IDH wild-type.
• **Surgical outcomes**:
	+ Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 67.5% of patients.
	+ Near-total resection (NTR) was achieved in 32.5% of patients.
	+ Mean extent of resection (EOR) was 99.31 ± 1.36%.
• **Survival outcomes**:
	+ Median overall survival was 364 days.
	+ Median progression-free survival was 198 days.

These findings provide valuable insights into the characteristics and treatment outcomes for patients with glioblastomas, which can inform future research and clinical practice.


#Discussion

The discussion highlights the limitations of existing public MRI collections for glioblastoma research, specifically the lack of early postoperative studies and tumor segmentations. The authors emphasize the importance of including these features to facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns and improve segmentation algorithms.

The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection is noted as a valuable resource, but it lacks early postoperative assessments and does not provide segmentations. In contrast, the UPENN-GBM and UCSF-PDGM collections include expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities, but they have limitations in terms of follow-up studies and preoperative-only scans.

The HURH-GBM collection is presented as a valuable addition to existing resources, offering early postoperative studies, recurrence scans, and expert-corrected segmentations. This dataset has the potential to facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns and serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.

Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of comprehensive MRI collections that include early postoperative studies, tumor segmentations, and follow-up scans to advance glioblastoma research.
