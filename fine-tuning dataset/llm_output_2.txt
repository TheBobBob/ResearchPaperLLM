#Summary 

This study aimed to identify the regulatory mechanism controlling sugar accumulation in peaches, a crucial factor in maintaining market competitiveness. Using a transcriptomic approach with gene co-expression network analysis, researchers analyzed an 'O × N' peach population previously studied for its genetic control of soluble solids content (SSC). The study identified 91 differentially expressed genes on chromosome 5 as potential regulators of sugar accumulation, along with a regulatory network involving genes related to sugar transport, flavonoid biosynthesis, and transcription factors. The findings contribute to a better understanding of SSC regulation in peaches, offering practical applications for breeding programs focused on fruit quality improvement.


#Background and Significance

The Chilean fresh fruit export industry is renowned for its high-quality products, particularly grapes, apples, tomatoes, cherries, and peaches. The country's peach production has been reported to reach 302,578 tons in 2021. Sweetness is a crucial attribute influencing fruit quality, and the quantification of sweetness is grounded in soluble solids content (SSC), primarily sugars. Achieving optimal sweetness levels requires a harmonious balance between sugars, acids, and other chemical components.

The significance of this study lies in its focus on understanding the importance of sweetness in peach production. The research aims to investigate the factors influencing sweetness levels in peaches, with potential implications for improving fruit quality and enhancing the competitiveness of Chilean peach exports. By exploring the relationship between sweetness and other chemical components, this study has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective strategies for optimizing peach quality and increasing its appeal to consumers.

#Results

The study identified 91 differentially expressed genes on chromosome 5 of the peach genome that are putative regulators of sugar accumulation. The findings also revealed a regulatory network involving genes associated with:

• Sugar transport (PpSWEET15)
• Cellulose biosynthesis (PpCSLG2)
• Flavonoid biosynthesis (PpPAL1)
• Pectin modifications (PpPG, PpPL, and PpPMEi)
• Expansins (PpEXPA1 and PpEXPA8)
• Transcription factors (PpC3H67, PpHB7, PpRVE1, and PpCBF4) involved in the SSC phenotype

These results contribute to a better understanding of the genetic control of sugar content in peaches, providing valuable insights for future breeding programs.


#Discussion

The discussion section highlights the findings from the transcriptomic analysis of the 'O × N' peach population, focusing on the soluble solids content (SSC) trait. The authors identify 12 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that colocalize with the QTL for SSC in the 'O × N' population, which could be regulatory genes controlling sugar accumulation.

The study suggests that transcription factors PpbHLH14, PpMYB98, and _PpMADS6_ may play a role in regulating SSC, along with candidate genes PpPG, PpSUS6, and three other transcription factors. However, more analysis is needed to confirm the participation of these genes.

The authors also identify sugar accumulation-related genes PpSWEET1 and _PpSWEET15_ as highly expressed in HighSSC individuals, which could be responsible for the observed differences in SSC trait. The correlation between gene expression values and SSC phenotype is validated, suggesting that these genes are involved in regulating sugar accumulation.

Furthermore, the study finds correlations between the SSC trait and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and cell wall remodeling processes. Candidate genes PpPAL1 and PpCSLG2 show strong correlations with SSC, indicating a link between these processes and SSC.

The discussion highlights the potential regulatory mechanisms controlling SSC and suggests that further analysis is needed to confirm the findings. The study contributes to our understanding of the genetic regulation of sugar accumulation in peach trees and provides insights into the broader research context of fruit development and quality traits.
