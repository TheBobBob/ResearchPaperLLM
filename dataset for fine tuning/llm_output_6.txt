#Summary

The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is a publicly available dataset that addresses the limitations of existing MRI repositories in glioblastoma research. The dataset features multiparametric MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. By providing expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions, the dataset enables the development of algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.


#Background and Significance

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts. The integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based algorithms has improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial data source in this domain, with public repositories like TCIA and BraTS providing valuable datasets for research.

However, these resources have limitations, focusing primarily on preoperative studies with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited expert annotations. To address these constraints, the Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is introduced, featuring multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis.

The significance of this study lies in its ability to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. By publicly disseminating this dataset, researchers can develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.


Here is a summarized version of the Methods section:

**#Methods**

• **Patient population**: Consecutive patients with WHO grade 4 astrocytoma who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022, with gross total resections (GTR) or near-total resections (NTR), and availability of MRI studies at three time points: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up.

• **Clinical, Pathological, and Imaging Data**: Collected from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, operative adjuncts, extent of resection, postoperative neurological deficits, chemotherapy and radiotherapy details, overall survival, and progression-free survival times.

• **Image Preprocessing**:
	+ Converted images to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using dicom2niix tool.
	+ Registered T1ce scans to SRI24 anatomical atlas space using FLIRT.
	+ Registered other MRI series (T1w, T2w, FLAIR, ADC maps) to the transformed T1ce scan.
	+ Extracted brain from co-registered scans using Synthstrip.

• **Intensity Z-scoring normalization**: Performed using Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk).

• **Tumor Subregions Segmentations**:
	+ Used preprocessed images as input for generating computer-aided segmentations using Deep-Medic.
	+ Obtained three labels: necrosis, peritumoral signal alteration, and enhancing tumor.
	+ Manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons.

#Results

The study population consisted of 40 patients with glioblastomas, with an average age of 63 ± 9 years and a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while the remaining 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy.

Key findings:

• **Demographics**: The study population consisted of 28 men (70%) and 12 women (30%), with an average age of 63 ± 9 years.
• **IDH status**: 4 patients (10%) had IDH-mutated glioblastomas, while 36 patients (90%) had IDH wild-type tumors.
• **Surgical outcomes**:
	+ Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 27 patients (67.5%).
	+ Near-total resection (NTR) was achieved in 13 patients (32.5%).
	+ The mean extent of resection (EOR) was 99.31 ± 1.36%.
• **Survival outcomes**:
	+ Median overall survival was 364 days.
	+ Median progression-free survival was 198 days.

These findings provide valuable insights into the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with glioblastomas, which can inform future research and clinical practice.


#Discussion

The current public MRI collections for glioblastoma patients have contributed significantly to advancements in the field, but they primarily focus on preoperative studies and lack information on tumor resection extent. The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection offers longitudinal studies, but it lacks early postoperative assessments and segmentations. Recent datasets from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPENN-GBM) and The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI (UCSF-PDGM) provide expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities, but they have limitations in terms of follow-up studies and early postoperative scans.

The HURH-GBM collection addresses these limitations by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans. The inclusion of patients with gross total resection may facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns, and the provided labels can serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.
