**ABSTRACT:**
Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive primary brain tumor, is associated with poor patient
outcomes. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a critical role in diagnosing,
characterizing, and forecasting glioblastoma progression, public MRI repositories present
significant drawbacks, including insufficient postoperative and follow-up studies as well
as expert tumor segmentations. To address these issues, we present the "Río Hortega
University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM)," a collection of multiparametric
MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for glioblastoma
patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. The dataset features
expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions, offering valuable ground truth data
for developing algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.
The public release of the RHUH-GBM dataset significantly contributes to glioblastoma
research, enabling the scientific community to study recurrence patterns and develop new
diagnostic and prognostic models. This may result in more personalized, effective treatments and ultimately improved patient outcomes.

**INTRODUCTION**
Glioblastoma, the most prevalent primary brain tumor, carries a dismal prognosis despite
the extensive efforts of clinical trials and research investigations. In recent years, the integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based
algorithms has catalyzed the quest to optimize diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models.
A key data source leveraged in this domain is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Public MRI repositories, such as The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) [1] and the Multimodal
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge dataset [2–4], have supplied a wealth of data
for research in this field.
Nonetheless, these public resources have predominantly focused on preoperative studies,
encompassing patients with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited
expert annotations, while primarily featuring structural sequences of MRI modalities. To
address these constraints, we introduce the “Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma
Dataset (RHUH-GBM)", comprising multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images
captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative (within 72 hours),
and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis. Furthermore, the dataset exclusively contains patients who have undergone total or near-total resection of the enhancing
tumor, along with tumor subregion segmentations for each time point. Complementing
this data are clinical information, volumetric assessments of resection extents, molecular
data, and survival details.


-----

By publicly disseminating this dataset, we aim to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection, and facilitate the development of novel registration and segmentation algorithms
tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.

By publicly disseminating this dataset, we aim to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection, and facilitate the development of novel registration and segmentation algorithms
tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.






**METHODS**
**Patient population**
The dataset comprises consecutive patients who underwent surgery between January 2018
and December 2022, with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of WHO grade 4 astrocytoma. Forty patients were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) Gross
total resections (GTR) or Near Total Resection (NTR), defined as having no residual
tumor enhancement and an extent of resection exceeding 95% of the initial enhancing
volume, respectively [5,6]. 2) Availability of MRI studies at three time points: preoperative, early postoperative (within 72 hours), and follow-up studies during which recurrence
was diagnosed. 3) Availability of structural T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), T1
contrast-enhanced (T1ce), Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusionweighted imaging-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for each study. 4)
Receipt of adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the Stupp
protocol [7].
Patients with severe image acquisition artifacts or missing MRI series were excluded. The
modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria were utilized to determine tumor progression [8]. This study received approval from the Institutional Review
Board of the Río Hortega University Hospital and the Ethics Committee for Drug Research
(CEIm) of the West Valladolid Health Area (Ref. 22PI-208)

**Clinical, Pathological, and Imaging Data**
Clinical and pathological information was obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative Karnofsky Performance
Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, use of operative adjuncts, volumetric
assessment of the extent of resection of the contrast-enhancing and non-enhancing tumor,
presence of postoperative neurological deficits, details of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
received, and overall survival and progression-free survival times. In this collection, all
postoperative MRI scans were conducted at Río Hortega University Hospital. Out of the
total sample, a subset of 11 patients had initially undergone preoperative and subsequent
follow-up MRI scans at a secondary healthcare facility before being referred to the primary
center. Details of the MR imaging acquisition parameters are described in Supplementary
Table 1.

**Image Preprocessing**
Images were retrieved from the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format for subsequent processing.
The first step involved converting the images to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology
Initiative (NIfTI) format using the dicom2niix tool version v1.0.20220720 [9], available at
```
https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases/tag/v1.0.20220720. Subse
```
quently, the T1ce scans for each subject were registered to the SRI24 anatomical atlas space
[10 using the FLIRT (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool) 11,12 available at https:](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL)
```
//fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL. The T1w, T2w, FLAIR scans, and ADC maps

```
were then registered to the transformed T1ce scan, resulting in co-registered resampled volumes of 1 × 1 × 1 mm isotropic voxels. The brain was extracted from all co-registered scans
using a deep learning tool called Synthstrip [13], included in FreeSurfer v7.3.0, available at
```
https://github.com/freesurfer/freesurfer/tree/dev/mri_synthstrip.

```

-----

Finally, intensity Z-scoring normalization was performed using the normalization tools
included in Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk) v1.9.0 [14] [available at https:](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/captk/)
```
//www.nitrc.org/projects/captk/

```
**Tumor Subregions Segmentations**
The preprocessed images from each time point were used as input for generating computeraided segmentations using Deep-Medic [15]. Three labels were subsequently obtained, corresponding to 1 - necrosis, 2 - peritumoral signal alteration, including edema and nonenhancing tumor, and 3 - enhancing tumor. All segmentations were carefully reviewed and
manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons specializing in neuroimaging (S.C. and
S.G.), who have a solid background in such tasks.
**METHODS**


**RESULTS**
A summary of the demographic data is presented in Table 1. The patients had an average
age of 63 ± 9 years, consisting of 28 men (70%) and 12 women (30%). The median
preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score was 80. Out of the 40 patients, 38
(95%) were diagnosed with de novo glioblastomas, while two patients (5%) had recurrent


-----

glioblastomas previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy. Four cases (10%) were
IDH-mutated, and 36 cases (90%) were IDH wild-type.
The mean preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume was 34.99 ± 26.59, and the
mean postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor volume was 0.23 ± 0.47. The mean
preoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality was 73.14 ± 43.63, while the mean postoperative
T2/FLAIR abnormality was 35.00 ± 26.74. Among the patients, 27 (67.5%) underwent
gross total resection, and 13 (32.5%) underwent near-total resection. The mean extent of
resection (EOR) was 99.31 ± 1.36%. The median overall survival was 364 days, and the
median progression-free survival was 198 days.

**DISCUSSION**
Numerous public MRI collections, comprising glioblastoma patients, are available for researchers investigating this aggressive form of brain cancer. These collections have significantly contributed to advancements in the field. Notable datasets include The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) [16], Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Glioblastoma (CPTAC-GBM) [17], Quantitative Imaging Network Glioblastoma (QIN GBM) [18], American College of Radiology Imaging Network
Fluoromisonidazole-Brain (ACRIN-FMISO-Brain) [19,20], and Brain Tumor Segmentation
(BraTS) Challenge 2021 [2–4] . While these collections are invaluable, they primarily focus on preoperative studies and often lack information on the extent of tumor resection
performed. Furthermore, only the BraTS dataset includes tumor segmentations.
The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) [21] collection offers longitudinal studies
for 39 patients, but not all include early postoperative assessments. Additionally, this
collection features patients with subtotal resections and does not provide segmentations.
The recent Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans for de novo
Glioblastoma (GBM) patients from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPENNGBM) [22] and The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI
(UCSF-PDGM) [23] collections contain 611 and 501 cases, respectively. These datasets include expert-refined segmentations and additional perfusion and diffusion modalities. However, the UPENN-GBM dataset has a limited 8.9% of patients with follow-up studies and
lacks early postoperative MRI scans. Meanwhile, the UCSF-PDGM dataset provides only
preoperative studies for the 402 grade 4 astrocytoma cases.
The HURH-GBM collection enhances the available resources by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans. The dataset’s expert-corrected segmentations
are especially advantageous for postoperative scans, given the labor-intensive and timeconsuming nature of differentiating peritumoral T2-FLAIR alterations from postoperative
changes such as edema, hemorrhage, and ischemia. The inclusion of patients with gross
total resection in this collection may potentially facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns. Additionally, the provided labels could act as ground truths for the
development of segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and
follow-up studies.
