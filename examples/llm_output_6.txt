#Summary

This systematic review aimed to investigate the effect of acute caffeine intake on pupil control in humans. The study found that existing literature on the topic is heterogeneous, with varying methods and results. Caffeine's ability to antagonize adenosine receptors and stimulate the release of catecholamines may influence pupil regulation. While some studies suggest a possible association between caffeine intake and pupil dilation, the findings are not robust enough to draw firm conclusions. The review highlights the need for more rigorous research designs, larger sample sizes, and consistent methods to establish a clearer understanding of this relationship.


#Background and Significance

Caffeine is a widely consumed stimulant that has been shown to have various effects on human physiology. The primary mechanism of caffeine's action in the body is its ability to antagonize adenosine, which can impact circadian rhythms and sleep behavior. Previous research suggests that caffeine may potentiate non-image-forming effects of light, such as regulating rest-activity cycles and melatonin secretion.

The pupil plays a crucial role in regulating the amount of light entering the eye, and its diameter is influenced by various factors, including age, mental load, mood, and alertness. Caffeine can stimulate the release of catecholamines, which can increase activity in the autonomic nervous system and affect pupil size.

The study of caffeine's effects on pupil control is significant because it may provide insights into how this stimulant can modulate light-induced responses. The intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the human retina are responsible for regulating circadian rhythms, and their activation by melanopsin can modify retinal illumination.

The research problem addressed in this study is the unknown extent to which caffeine intake affects pupil control in humans. By investigating this relationship, the study aims to close a critical gap in the literature and provide insights into how caffeine may enhance light effects on the circadian system.

Overall, this study has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between caffeine, light, and the circadian system, which can inform strategies for improving sleep quality and regulating circadian rhythms.


Here is the summarized methods section:

#Methods

• **Risk of Bias (RoB) tool 2.0**: Used to assess the risk of bias in each study, with seven domains evaluated: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of personnel and participants, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias.

• **Search strategy**:
	+ Searched multiple databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, and medRxiv.
	+ Used subject headings and keywords to search for studies on caffeine and pupil size.
	+ Example search terms: (caffeine and pupil*).af, 1 Pupil/, 2 (pupil* adj3 (size or enlarge* or large* or dilat* or small or constrict* or contract*)).ti,ab,kw, etc.

• **Data extraction variables**:
	+ Extracted data from each study using a standardized table with the following categories: article information, study design, sample details, caffeine details, and pupil size measurement details.
	+ Collected information on study design, sample size, self-reported daily caffeine intake, blinding method, and other relevant parameters.

• **Qualitative review**: Performed due to differences in study design, caffeine administration, and pupil measurement methods across the seven included studies.


#Results

The studies analyzed did not provide consistent results, with some finding an effect of caffeine on pupil diameter in the form of dilation. The main findings are:

• Three studies found a significant effect of caffeine on pupil diameter:
	+ Redondo et al. [38] found a significant main effect 30 minutes after capsule ingestion.
	+ Abokyi et al. [40] found significantly greater effects at time points 30, 60, and 90 minutes.
	+ Wilhelm et al. [44] found a clear effect on the pupillary unrest index.
• However, four studies did not find an effect of caffeine on pupil diameter:
	+ Krueger et al. [41], Bardak et al. [42], and Nicholson et al. [43] could not provide data supporting pupil dilation after caffeine consumption.
• The study by Lanini et al. [39] found a significant difference between the caffeine and non-caffeine groups, but this difference did not interact with time and returned to baseline.

Overall, most studies cannot support the thesis of pupil dilation due to acute caffeine intake.


#Discussion

The discussion section highlights the limitations of previous studies on acute caffeine intake and pupil dilation in humans. Due to methodological differences between studies, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions or use quantitative methods to analyze the data. The varying doses of caffeine used across studies also make it challenging to identify consistent effects. Furthermore, the combination of small caffeine doses with inadequate abstinence durations and early administration times can lead to negligible effects on pupil control.
