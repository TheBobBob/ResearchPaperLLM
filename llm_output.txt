#Summary

This study investigates the communication between sensory neurons (SNs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in bone metabolism, remodeling, and repair. The researchers used microfluidic devices to mimic the physiological scenario of innervation and found that SNs regulate EC functions through sensory neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). Specifically, they showed that capsaicin-stimulated SNs induce increased Ca[2+] influx in ECs, stimulate NO production, and decrease inhibitory eNOS T495 phosphorylation site. The study highlights the significance of neurovascular coupling in bone biology and suggests that SNs play an important role in controlling endothelial cell functions through CGRP production and NO-dependent pathways.


#Background and Significance

Human bone is a complex tissue with a coupling between blood vessels and nerve fibers. Nerve fibers are present throughout the bone tissue, but more abundant in the periosteum and highly vascularized regions. This anatomical and functional coupling has been shown to play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including bone regeneration.

Previous studies have demonstrated that sensory nerves can coordinate aspects of vascularization and vascular cells through common mechanisms during development and regeneration. Both vascular and nervous tissues share common signaling molecules, such as angiogenic and neurogenic factors, which are secreted by endothelial cells and nerve cells to maintain their respective functions.

The study of the interplay between sensory neurons (SNs) and endothelial cells (ECs) is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling. This coupling has been shown to be mediated by various signaling pathways, including calcium (Ca[2][+]) signaling, which involves the propagation of increases in intracellular Ca[2][+] through a cell network.

The significance of this study lies in its potential to uncover new mechanisms of action and signaling pathways involved in the crosstalk between SNs and ECs. By exploring the effect of SNs on ECs' Ca[2][+] signaling, Cx43 expression, and NO endothelial-dependent pathways, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of neurovascular coupling and its role in bone regeneration.

The importance of this research lies in its potential to provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for bone-related disorders.

#Results

The study found that sensory neurons (SNs) play an important role in controlling endothelial cell functions through the production of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The key findings are:

• SNs stimulate increased calcium influx in endothelial cells (ECs).
• SNs increase nitric oxide (NO) production in ECs, likely by decreasing eNOS T495 phosphorylation site.
• CGRP produced by SNs is a mediator of this effect on ECs, as NO production decreases in the presence of a CGRP antagonist and increases when ECs are stimulated with synthetic CGRP.

These findings suggest that sensory neurons regulate endothelial cell functions through the release of CGRP and the activation of the NO signaling pathway.


**#Discussion**

The discussion section highlights the findings on neurovascular coupling and its regulation by sensory neurons (SNs) in endothelial cells (ECs). The study confirms that SNs play a crucial role in controlling EC functions, such as migration and network formation. Additionally, it explores the involvement of MAPK signaling proteins, specifically ERK1/2 and p38, in processes like angiogenesis.

Key findings include:

* SNs modulate EC functions through neurovascular coupling.
* ERK1/2 phosphorylation ratio is downregulated in ECs co-cultured with SNs at day 7 compared to day 4.
* The presence of AntSP (antagonist of substance P) upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation ratio in ECs co-cultured with SNs at day 7.

Implications:

* Neurovascular coupling is a complex process involving multiple cell types and signaling pathways.
* SNs can modulate EC functions through the regulation of MAPK signaling proteins like ERK1/2 and p38.
* The study highlights the importance of considering the interactions between different cell types in physiological processes, such as angiogenesis.

Connections to broader research context:

* The findings support previous studies on neurovascular coupling and its role in regulating endothelial cell functions.
* The study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between sensory neurons, endothelial cells, and MAPK signaling proteins in physiological processes like angiogenesis.
