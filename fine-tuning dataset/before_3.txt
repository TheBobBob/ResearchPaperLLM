**Abstract**
**Background Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are essential for the maintenance and initiation of male**
spermatogenesis. Despite the advances in understanding SSC biology in mouse models, the mechanisms underlying
human SSC development remain elusive.

#Summary


**Fig. 7 Graphic abstracts of this study. Using single-cell sequencing analysis and in vitro experiments, we found that Leydig cell-derived PTN promotes**
proliferation and self-renewal of human spermatogonial stem cells through binding to its ligand SDC2, and that their dysregulation may be associated
with non-obstructive azoospermia


Afterwards, we incubated sections overnight at 4°C with
the primary antibodies mentioned in Table S2. Following
three rinses with PBS, the sections were then treated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit sec­
ondary antibody and incubated at room temperature for
one hour. The color development was achieved using the
3,3’-diaminobenzidine chromogen kit (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark). The nucleus was stained with hematoxylin for
a duration of 7 min at room temperature. In immuno­
fluorescence, the primary antibody was incubated at 4 °C
for 16 h, followed by chromogenic development using
Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody. Addition­
ally, the cell nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamid­
ino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We captured and analyzed
microscopic images of testicular sections using a Zeiss
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).






**Conclusion**
In summary, we show that PTN secreted by Leydig cells
binds to SDC2 and regulates the growth and survival
of SSCs via GFRA1 (Fig. 7). Altered expression of PTN
and SDC2 may compromise spermatogenesis in NOA

**Results Here, we analyzed the signaling pathways involved in SSC regulation by testicular somatic cells using single-**
cell sequencing data (GEO datasets: GSE149512 and GSE112013) and identified that Leydig cells communicate with
SSCs through pleiotrophin (PTN) and its receptor syndecan-2 (SDC2). Immunofluorescence, STRING prediction, and
protein immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between PTN and SDC2 in spermatogonia, but their
co-localization was observed only in approximately 50% of the cells. The knockdown of SDC2 in human SSC lines
impaired cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and the expression of PLZF, a key marker for SSC self-renewal. Transcriptome
analysis revealed that SDC2 knockdown downregulated the expression of GFRA1, a crucial factor for SSC proliferation
and self-renewal, and inhibited the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Exogenous PTN rescued the proliferation and GFRA1
expression in SDC2 knockdown SSC lines. In addition, we found downregulation of PTN and SDC2 as well as altered
localization in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients, suggesting that downregulation of PTN and SDC2 may
be associated with impaired spermatogenesis.


#Discussion


**Discussion**
SSCs serve as the source of spermatogenesis and pro­
vide continuous support for the production of sperm
throughout a male’s lifetime [8]. SSCs in mice possess the
capacity to revive spermatogenesis in the receiving testis

[5], offering a fresh approach to addressing male infertil­
ity, particularly NOA. Nevertheless, the lack of under­
standing regarding the regulatory mechanisms of human
SSCs poses a hindrance to the implementation of stem
cell therapy for male infertility. Intrinsic molecules and
the testis microenvironment drive the fate decision of
SSCs [23]. The testicular microenvironment is crucial for
the preservation and specialization of SSCs. In general,
the self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs are regulated
by Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells
through the secretion of growth factors and the provi­
sion of structural support, as commonly believed [38].
