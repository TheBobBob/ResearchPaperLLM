#Summary

This study investigates the role of Leydig cell-derived PTN in regulating human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The researchers found that PTN promotes SSC proliferation and self-renewal by binding to its ligand SDC2, which may be associated with non-obstructive azoospermia. The study used single-cell sequencing analysis and in vitro experiments to identify the mechanism of action. The findings suggest that altered expression of PTN and SDC2 may compromise spermatogenesis in NOA, highlighting the significance of this pathway in male fertility.

**#Results**

The study analyzed single-cell sequencing data to investigate signaling pathways regulating Spermatogonial Stem Cells (SSCs). Key findings include:

• **PTN-SDC2 interaction**: Leydig cells communicate with SSCs through pleiotrophin (PTN) and its receptor syndecan-2 (SDC2), confirmed by immunofluorescence, STRING prediction, and protein immunoprecipitation assays.
• **SDC2 knockdown effects**: Knocking down SDC2 in human SSC lines impairs cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and expression of PLZF, a key marker for SSC self-renewal.
• **Transcriptome analysis**: SDC2 knockdown downregulates GFRA1 expression, a crucial factor for SSC proliferation and self-renewal, and inhibits the HIF-1 signaling pathway.
• **Exogenous PTN rescue**: Exogenous PTN rescues the proliferation and GFRA1 expression in SDC2-knockdown SSC lines.
• **Clinical relevance**: Downregulation of PTN and SDC2 is observed in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients, suggesting a potential link between impaired spermatogenesis and downregulation of these signaling molecules.


**#Discussion**

The discussion highlights the significance of Spermatogonial Stem Cells (SSCs) in spermatogenesis and their potential to revive fertility in cases of male infertility, particularly Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA). The authors emphasize that understanding the regulatory mechanisms of human SSCs is crucial for developing stem cell therapy. They note that intrinsic molecules and the testicular microenvironment drive the fate decision of SSCs, with Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells playing key roles in regulating self-renewal and differentiation through growth factor secretion and structural support.

In summary, the discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding human SSC regulatory mechanisms to develop effective stem cell therapy for male infertility.
