**Abstract**
**Background Zebrafish are widely used in various research fields and to fulfil the diverse research needs, numerous**
zebrafish lines are available, each with a unique domestication background, potentially resulting in intraspecies differ‑
ences in specific biological functions. Few studies have compared multiple zebrafish lines under identical conditions
to investigate both inter- and intra-line variability related to different functions. However, such variability could pose
a challenge for the reproducibility of results in studies utilising zebrafish, particularly when the line used is not clearly
specified. This study assessed growth, stress status (cortisol, serotonin) and reproductive capabilities (maturity, fecun‑
dity, fertilisation rate, sperm quality) of four commonly used wild-type zebrafish lines (AB, SJD, TU, WIK) using stand‑
ardized protocols.
**Results The stress markers levels were found to be similar across the lines, indicating that the endocrine stress**
status is robust to diverse domestication histories. Variations were observed in the growth and reproductive param‑
eters. The lines exhibited differences in the timing of puberty (86 dpf for AB and SJD lines vs. 107 dpf for the WIK
line) despite achieving similar sizes, suggesting that there are line-specific variations in the induction of maturation.
Additionally, the AB line demonstrated higher sperm quality than did the other lines and higher fecundity and fertili‑
zation rates than did the SJD line. The AB line also exhibiting a smaller adult size but a heavier brain relative to its body
weight.

**Conclusion**
Our results highlight for the first time that differences
may exist among various wild-type zebrafish lines reared
in exactly same conditions, particularly concerning both
development and reproduction. These differences could
be a problem for reproducibility of research results, especially because many studies do not precisely mention the
zebrafish line used or the origin of the line. Opting for a
specific line could influence the results of a given study
and affect the generalisability of the findings to other
populations. Importantly, selecting a commonly used
line does not necessarily ensure the representativeness of
the overall results. When selecting a zebrafish line, it is
crucial to consider the biological relevance of the characteristics specific to each line. The line choice must be
deliberate, guided by an in-depth understanding of the
specific characteristics sought and the known genetic
and/or phenotypic variations among the zebrafish lines.

**Discussion**
In recent decades, the zebrafish model has become
increasingly popular in research [22, 23]. Consequently,
to meet the needs of researchers, several zebrafish lines
have been made available [6]. Each of these lines has
evolved through a different process of adaptation to laboratory conditions, marked by distinct and specific choices
of the founder populations, the genetic selection methods applied, the way the lines were reproduced and the
number of generations reared in captivity [5, 7, 18–20].
Taken together, these findings may explain the differences in phenotypes among these lines. The aim of this
study was to compare key parameters related to growth,
stress response, and reproduction in commonly used WT
lines bred under the same laboratory conditions to identify potential differences and similarities among them.
Stress hormones are classical physiological indicators
used to evaluate stress responses in fish. In this study, the
cortisol levels were very similar among the four tested
lines. These measured whole-body cortisol levels can be
interpreted as the basal cortisol level since the hormone


peak in zebrafish occurs 15 min after stress induction [25,
26], while levels were measured less than 5 min after capture in this study. Similarly, equivalent serotonin brain
levels between the AB and TU lines have been reported
in the literature [27], and we confirmed this trend among
the four lines tested (Fig. 5). This similarity between the
two hormones might be explained by the relationship
between serotonin and cortisol, the former playing a role
in the release of the latter [28]. Therefore, these results
are an initial indication that the level of stress hormones
in zebrafish is potentially robust to the different domestication routes applied and that the line choice is not a key
parameter impacting the results for endocrine evaluation
of basal stress in zebrafish.
One of the factors that makes the zebrafish an increasingly popular animal model is its short life cycle.
Zebrafish are mature at approximatively 3 months of age

[5], even if puberty is more related to body growth than
to age in both sexes [29, 30]. Our comparisons of the AB,
SJD, TU and WIK lines highlighted differences in both
growth and puberty timing. The AB and SJD lines were
