#Summary

The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is a publicly available dataset that aims to improve glioblastoma research by providing multiparametric MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. The dataset addresses the limitations of existing public repositories by including expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions, enabling the development of algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans. By analyzing this dataset, researchers can study recurrence patterns and develop new diagnostic and prognostic models, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective treatments for glioblastoma patients.


#Background and Significance

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts. The integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based algorithms has improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key data source in this domain, with public repositories like TCIA and BraTS providing valuable datasets for research.

However, these resources have limitations, focusing primarily on preoperative studies with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited expert annotations. To address these constraints, the Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is introduced, featuring multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis.

The significance of this study lies in its ability to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. By publicly disseminating this dataset, researchers can develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans. This has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, patient outcomes, and our understanding of glioblastoma recurrence.


#Methods

This study retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022 with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of WHO grade 4 astrocytoma. The inclusion criteria were: gross total resections (GTR) or near-total resections (NTR), availability of MRI studies at three time points, and receipt of adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the Stupp protocol.

The study population consisted of 40 patients who met these criteria. Clinical and pathological information was obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, use of operative adjuncts, volumetric assessment of the extent of resection, presence of postoperative neurological deficits, details of chemotherapy and radiotherapy received, and overall survival and progression-free survival times.

The MRI scans were retrieved from the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format for subsequent processing. The images were converted to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using the dicom2niix tool, then registered to the SRI24 anatomical atlas space using FLIRT. The T1w, T2w, FLAIR scans, and ADC maps were then registered to the transformed T1ce scan.

The brain was extracted from all co-registered scans using a deep learning tool called Synthstrip, included in FreeSurfer v7.3.0. Intensity Z-scoring normalization was performed using the normalization tools included in Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk) v1.9.0.

Tumor subregions were segmented from the preprocessed images using Deep-Medic, resulting in three labels: necrosis, peritumoral signal alteration, and enhancing tumor. All segmentations were carefully reviewed and manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons specializing in neuroimaging.


#Results

The study population consisted of 40 patients with glioblastomas, with a mean age of 63 years (±9) and a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy.

The study found that:

* 67.5% of patients underwent gross total resection (GTR), and 32.5% underwent near-total resection (NTR).
* The mean extent of resection was 99.31% ± 1.36%.
* The median overall survival was 364 days, and the median progression-free survival was 198 days.
* IDH-mutated glioblastomas accounted for 10% of cases, while 90% were IDH wild-type.

The study also reported on various imaging metrics, including:

* Mean preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume: 34.99 ± 26.59
* Mean postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor volume: 0.23 ± 0.47
* Mean preoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality: 73.14 ± 43.63
* Mean postoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality: 35.00 ± 26.74

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the demographics and outcomes of patients with glioblastomas, as well as the effectiveness of various treatment approaches.


#Discussion

The current public MRI collections for glioblastoma patients have contributed significantly to advancements in the field, but they primarily focus on preoperative studies and lack information on tumor resection extent. The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection offers longitudinal studies, but it lacks early postoperative assessments and segmentations. Recent datasets from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPENN-GBM) and The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI (UCSF-PDGM) provide expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities, but they have limitations in terms of follow-up studies and early postoperative scans.

The HURH-GBM collection addresses these limitations by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans. The inclusion of patients with gross total resection may facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns. Additionally, the provided labels can serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.
