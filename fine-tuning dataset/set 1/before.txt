**Abstract**
Increasing evidences demonstrate the role of sensory innervation in bone metabolism, remodeling and repair,
however neurovascular coupling in bone is rarely studied. Using microfluidic devices as an indirect co-culture
model to mimic in vitro the physiological scenario of innervation, our group demonstrated that sensory neurons
(SNs) were able to regulate the extracellular matrix remodeling by endothelial cells (ECs), in particular through
sensory neuropeptides, i.e. calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). Nonetheless, still little
is known about the cell signaling pathways and mechanism of action in neurovascular coupling. Here, in order
to characterize the communication between SNs and ECs at molecular level, we evaluated the effect of SNs and
the neuropeptides CGRP and SP on ECs. We focused on different pathways known to play a role on endothelial
functions: calcium signaling, p38 and Erk1/2; the control of signal propagation through Cx43; and endothelial
functions through the production of nitric oxide (NO). The effect of SNs was evaluated on ECs Ca[2+] influx, the
expression of Cx43, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, p38, ERK1/2 as
well as their phosphorylated forms. In addition, the role of CGRP and SP were either analyzed using respective
antagonists in the co-culture model, or by adding directly on the ECs monocultures. We show that capsaicinstimulated SNs induce increased Ca[2+] influx in ECs. SNs stimulate the increase of NO production in ECs, probably
involving a decrease in the inhibitory eNOS T495 phosphorylation site. The neuropeptide CGRP, produced by
SNs, seems to be one of the mediators of this effect in ECs since NO production is decreased in the presence of
CGRP antagonist in the co-culture of ECs and SNs, and increased when ECs are stimulated with synthetic CGRP.
Taken together, our results suggest that SNs play an important role in the control of the endothelial cell functions
through CGRP production and NO signaling pathway.

**Introduction**
Human bone is a fully vascularized and innervated tissue,
with a coupling between blood vessels and nerve fibers

[1]. Nerve fibers can be found throughout the bone tissue
but are more abundant in the periosteum and in highly
vascularized and metabolically active regions [2]. Vas­
cularization and innervation are anatomically and func­
tionally coupled in bone tissue, nerve fibers are present
along the blood vessels and, at the same time, nerve fibers
contain blood capillary networks. Following these obser­
vations, we and others have shown that sensory nerves
can coordinate some aspects of vascularization and vas­
cular cells [3–6], sharing common mechanisms during
their development as well as during the bone regenera­
tion process [4] through a variety of neurogenic or nonneurogenic factors [6].

Indeed, both vascular and nervous tissues share com­

mon signaling molecules. Endothelial cells and nerve
cells can both secrete angiogenic and neurogenic factors
during vessel and nerve formation as well as to maintain
their respective functions. In 2017, Yuan et al., reported
that human microvascular endothelial cells promote the
development of dorsal root ganglion neurons at least via
BDNF pathway in a co-culture system and the activation
of ERK pathway [7]. In turn, sensory nerves can secrete
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P
(SP), both classic sensory neuropeptides, that stimulate
endothelial cell proliferation and in vivo angiogenesis [8],
and control endothelial cell function. SP also can stimu­
late nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells and
then protect the bone vasculature [9]. However, while
multiple factors have been identified in the coupling
between innervation and vascularization, there is still a
variety of mechanisms of action and signaling pathways
in the SNs and ECs interplay that remains yet to be elu­
cidated [10].

In our previous work, we have used microfluidic cham­

bers to mimic the innervation process, where cell inter­
actions were achieved through axons emitted by neurons
toward the ECs. These devices also permitted to analyze
the two cell populations at proteomic and gene levels and
thereafter enabled the evaluation of the influence of sen­
sory neurons (SNs) on the target cells [3, 11]. We have
first demonstrated in vitro that rat primary SNs were able
to enhance the expression of angiogenic markers in rat
bone marrow-derived endothelial cells, and more spe­
cifically to stimulate extracellular matrix remodeling [3]
through MMPs activities.

Here, we propose to explore the interplay and cell sig­

naling mechanisms on the effect of sensory neurons on
endothelial cells. Numerous mechanisms, known as neu­
rovascular coupling, have been explored and were a point
of focus in this study. Among them, endothelial Ca[2][+] sig­
naling, constitutes an emerging pathway in the regulation


of neurovascular coupling [12]. In this respect, intercellu­
lar calcium (Ca[2][+]) waves, that represent the propagation
of increases in intracellular Ca[2][+] through a cell network,
appear to be a fundamental mechanism for coordinating
multicellular responses [12]. The calcium propagation
predominately involves cell to cell communication, with
internal messengers moving _via gap junctions, includ­_
ing the connexin family, e.g. connexin 43 (Cx43), or other
messengers mediating paracrine signaling [13] with a
special emphasis on the possible participation of NO and
endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in this process [14].

A second focus has been drawn on the classical sen­

sory neuropeptides released in close proximity to the
vascularized tissue, and which can then directly modu­
late functions of endothelial cells. Previously, we showed
that SNs, indirectly co-cultured with ECs, secreted CGRP
and SP that could regulate ECs functions [3]. Similar to
CGRP, it has long been described that SP induces endo­
thelium-dependent vasodilation through the activation
of nitric oxide synthase and thus release of nitric oxide

[15–17]. It is thought that angiogenesis in bone is in part
the result of SP release and endothelial progenitor cells
migration from the bone marrow into the injured periph­
eral tissue [18, 19]. In addition, it has been shown in dif­
ferent vascular systems that SP-induced vasodilation
is mediated by cyclic-GMP signaling through different
pathways involving endothelial NO or direct endothelialindependent pathways [20].

In such context, the aim of this study is to further

explore the cell-cell communication between endothe­
lial cells and sensory neurons using microfluidic devices
by evaluating the mechanism of action and the signaling
pathways involved in their crosstalk. We investigated the
effect of SNs on ECs’ Ca[2][+] signaling, Cx43 expression and
the impact on the NO endothelial-dependent pathways.
We focused on the classical neuropeptides CGRP and SP,
using their specific antagonists, as mechanism of action
of SNs on ECs, evaluating also their respective role on
this neurovascular coupling and cell signaling.



**Conclusion**
We showed that capsaicin-stimulated SNs could induce
Ca[2][+] influx in ECs and we analyzed the effect of the
two classical sensory peptides CGRP and SP on the
protein levels and phosphorylation of potential actors
impacted by the calcium influx in ECs. SNs increased
NO production in ECs, probably involving a decrease
in the inhibitory eNOS T495 phosphorylation site. The

#Discussion


**Discussion**
Neurovascular coupling is a set of mechanisms regulat­
ing the exchanges between nerves and blood vessels, and
more precisely at the cellular level, between endothelial
cells and neural cells. Some of these mechanisms have
been described [37, 38], but most of them remain unclear,
which confirm the need for further study of the interplay
between these cell types that can support the regulation
of angiogenesis by nerve fibers. In more details, through


significant upregulation of p-Erk1/2 in the presence of
AntSP relative to the vehicle (Fig. 5f).

In order to explore a possible role of SP on Erk1/2

expression and phosphorylation, we cultured ECs in well
plates in the presence of 100 nM CGRP and 1 µM SP and
analyzed by western blot (Fig. 5g, Supplementary Fig. 5).
No significant differences were observed in Erk1/2
expression (Fig. 5h) and in the Erk1/2 phosphorylation
ratio (Fig. 5i) in relation to the vehicle.

this coupling, local neuronal activity plays an impor­
tant role on angiogenesis and physiology of neighboring
microvessels. In this context and based on our previous
data obtained in vitro on the effect of sensory neurons on
endothelial cells [3], our aim here was to discriminate the
cell signaling involved in the neurovascular coupling and
to focus on the role of the two neurotransmitters CGRP
and SP produced by sensory neurons on the cell commu­
nication with endothelial cells.

Among the responses of endothelial cells to different

chemical (e.g., neurotransmitters) and physical stimuli
(e.g., shear stress pulsatile stretch), the increase in intra­
cellular Ca[2][+] concentration can further trigger diverse
signaling pathways, known to regulate the expression of
angiogenic markers and EC functions [39].

In this work, we showed that the stimulation of SNs

with capsaicin results an increase on intracellular cal­
cium level in ECs (Fig. 1c-d). The effect of stimulation
of SNs by capsaicin was observed on a group of endo­
thelial cells whose resting [Ca[2 ][+] i] had been measured.
This observation suggests that the stimulation of SNs
by capsaicin and the subsequent release of vesicles [40],
including CGRP and SP, can be responsible for the cal­
cium influx observed in ECs. The role of CGRP and SP
has been previously identified in our work as mediators
stimulating the gene expression of angiogenic markers
of endothelial cell functions [3]. Our results also suggest
that [Ca[2 ][+] i] is increased in ECs in response to SNs stimu­
lation with capsaicin and that ECs communicate quickly
to present a harmonized response.

In particular, calcium signaling is known to occur _via_

gap junctions and connexin (Cx) hemichannels [30]. Gap
junctions are constituted by Cx that contain multiple
phosphorylation sites and the phosphorylation state is
well known to regulate the opening or closing of chan­
nels [41]. Among the Cx, Cx43 is one of the most widely
expressed connexin in tissues and cell lines, especially
in the vascularized bone tissue [41]. Phosphorylation of
Cx43 is known to be involved in the regulation of hemi­
channels and gap junctional communication through
trafficking, assembly/disassembly, degradation as well as
gap junction channel gating [42]. More precisely, it has
been described that Cx43 phosphorylation decreases
intercellular communication [42–45], however, Ca[2][+]
transfer is rarely affected. Indeed, even if Cx43 phosphor­
ylation can inhibit other molecules transfer such as IP3, it
allows Ca[2][+] movement [46]. Thus, the calcium signaling
in ECs observed in presence of SNs in the Fig. 1 might
still be mediated through Cx43 activity.

When looking at Cx43 in our co-culture model of ECs

with SNs, an increase in Cx43 expression over time likely
due to the increase in culture confluence (Fig. 2c), and
a tendency in the phosphorylation rate were observed
over time in the presence of SNs (Fig. 2d). Moreover,


Cx43 protein expression tends to be upregulated in the
presence of SNs relative to ECs cultured alone at day 4.
An upregulation of Cx43 has been shown to positively
modulate the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells by
stimulating endothelial cell migration and network for­
mation [47]. However, here, antagonists of CGRP and SP
had no significant influence on the Cx43 protein expres­
sion and phosphorylation ratio. Antagonist of SP may
have showed a tendency to decrease protein expression
(p = 0.07), but it did not influence significantly the phos­
phorylation ratio. These results should be interpreted
with caution and should be confirmed by further experi­
ments before concluding on the role of SNs and these
neuropeptides to control site-specific connexin phos­
phorylation, associated with a control of gap junctional
communication through Cx43.

NO is also a potent mediator produced by the eNOS

in ECs and is involved in endothelial functions by main­
taining vascular homeostasis for example [48]. A Ca[2][+]dependent regulation of eNOS producing NO has already
been described [49]. The eNOS is an important signal
generator involved in the control of vascular tone and
angiogenesis, regulated by several kinases acting at differ­
ent sites to activate or inhibit NO production. Our results
show that SNs increase NO production in ECs, probably
involving a decrease in the eNOS T495 phosphorylation
site without affecting eNOS protein expression, resulting
thus in a stimulatory effect on eNOS activity. While SP
seems not to be involved in the increase of NO produc­
tion (Fig. 3e-f), the neuropeptide CGRP seems to be one
of the mediators of this communication, since NO pro­
duction is decreased in the presence of AntCGRP in the
co-culture of ECs and SNs and increased when ECs are
stimulated with synthetic CGRP. Our data are in accor­
dance with the well-known vasodilator role of CGRP [50]
and importantly, identify an important mechanism in
which SNs can regulate ECs functions, in a NO-depen­
dent manner.

Interestingly, a study conducted by Gaete and coau­

thors have suggested a contradictory effect of CGRP
on NO production in mesenteric arterial beds [22]. The
authors showed that CGRP signaling inhibits NO pro­
duction through gap junction protein pannexin-1 chan­
nel activation in ECs. Besides we did not evaluate the role
of pannexin-1, here we used ECs isolated from bone mar­
row microvasculature. The differences in the cells and tis­
sues origin as well as the presence of different cell types
in mesenteric arterial beds may explain the contradictory
results observed in both situations. We developed an in
vitro model to elucidate the cell communication and sig­
naling between dissociated Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG)
cultures (including a mix of SNs and Schwann cells) and
endothelial cells. Our approach does not reflect the com­
plexity of the vascular tissue composition and response


-----

to SNs stimulation, however it allows us to describe the
particular ECs response and to identify the main actors
of their communication with SNs here and in our previ­
ous study [3].

Recently, an interesting relation between NO, Cx43 and

Ca[2][+] signaling has been suggested to regulate endothelial
cell migration, proposed by Espinoza and Figueroa [51].
Using rat primary microvascular endothelial cells and
a 2D migration scratch assay, the authors suggested the
involvement of NO-mediated S-nitrosylation in Cx43
hemichannels’ functions [51]. The activation of Cx43
hemichannels by S-nitrosylation should play a critical
role in the long-lasting increase in [Ca[2 ][+] i] that directs
endothelial cell migration and network formation, sug­
gesting that this mechanism may contribute to the NOmediated effects in angiogenesis. The data previously
published by our team showing that SNs and the neuro­
peptides SP and CGRP participate in the upregulation
of angiogenesis markers in ECs such as _Angpt1,_ _Col4,_
_Mmp2 and interestingly, VegfA [3]. As well known, VEGF_
play an important role in ECs by contributing to vascu­
lar integrity and endothelial homeostasis [52, 53] and
but also it stimulates eNOS expression and activation

[49, 54]. Here, we show that CGRP regulates NO pro­
duction, likely indirectly participating in the activation
of Cx43 channels through NO-mediated S-nitrosylation,
permitting the Ca[2][+] entry and thus triggering multiple
mechanisms stimulating ECs functions. In this sense, our
findings presented here show the increase in [Ca[2 ][+] i] in
ECs after SNs stimulation with capsaicin, a significant
upregulation of NO production in ECs co-cultured with
SNs, and only a tendency in Cx43 protein expression in
ECs co-cultured with SNs at day 4 (p = 0,07). These data
are in accordance with Espinoza’s and Figueroa’s observa­
tions and confirm that SNs play an important role in the
control of the endothelial cell functions such as migration
and network formation.

MAPK signaling proteins such as ERK1/2 and p38 are

also known to be involved in processes such as angio­
genesis by regulation of eNOS [55, 56] for example.
Moreover, the ERK1/2 and p38 have been shown to be
activated by the recognition of SP and CGRP, respec­
tively, by their receptors in mesenchymal stem cells [57].
This activation leads to the migration of MSCs to bone
formation sites and increased osteogenesis. Here, p38
protein expression and p38 phosphorylation ratio are not
modulated by the presence of SNs nor by the presence
of AntCGRP and AntSP at day 4 and day 7. Regarding
Erk1/2, a downregulation of phosphorylation ratio was
observed in ECs co-cultured with SNs at day 7 relative to
day 4 and ECs cultured alone at day 7 (Fig. 5c), followed
by an upregulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation ratio in the
presence of AntSP at day 7 (Fig. 5f). However, the effect
of the neuropeptide SP on Erk1/2 phosphorylation was


not confirmed when ECs alone were cultured in well
plates in the presence of 1µM SP. It is important to note
that when we identified the downregulation of Erk1/2
phosphorylation ratio at day 7 and the upregulation of
Erk1/2 phosphorylation ratio in the presence of AntSP,
the ECs were co-cultured with SNs, reflecting a more
complex physiological communication between both cell
types relative to the culture of ECs alone with the culture
medium supplemented with CGRP and SP individually.
Indeed, the neuropeptides availability and concentrations
are not the same for both situations, which can explain
the absence of effect of SP on Erk1/2 phosphorylation
ratio when SP was added to the ECs culture medium
(Fig. 5i). It is known that SNs secrete other molecules and
neuropeptides, which could take over or act in synergy
with SP, explaining why SP in ECs culture medium does
not significantly affect Erk1/2 phosphorylation ratio. A
similar scenario was observed in our previous study [3],
in which we identified that SP when in culture medium
can upregulate _Mmp2 expression, however when ECs_
were co-cultured with SNs in the presence of AntSP,
_Mmp2 expression was only significantly reduced when_
AntSP and AntCGRP were used combined, suggesting
that other molecules might be involved in the regulation
of Mmp2 expression by SNs.

It is well described in the literature that in ECs, Erk1/2

phosphorylation increases as a quick response followed
by an angiogenic signal, and then the phosphorylation
level is decreased due to the activity of Erk1/2 phospha­
tases [58, 59]. Here, the time course used for the analysis
of Erk1/2 expression and phosphorylation in the co-cul­
tured ECs (4 and 7 days allowing the neurite outgrowth),
that could impact angiogenesis, could not be appropri­
ate with a signal of the MAPK activities. However, in
our study, when we consider the Erk1/2 phosphoryla­
tion ratio in ECs co-cultured with SNs from day 4 to 7,
we observe a decrease in the phosphorylation ratio. This
downregulation could be the result of the Erk1/2 phos­
phatases activity, acting on a return of Erk1/2 phosphory­
lation ratio to a base level after an earlier stimulation.
Moreover, EC culture medium is a growth factor-rich
environment, including VEGF-A in the composition,
which could explain the high levels of Erk1/2 phosphor­
ylation ratio in the group of ECs cultured alone at both
time points.
