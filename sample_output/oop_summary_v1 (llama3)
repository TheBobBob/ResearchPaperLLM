##Summary

The paper introduces the "Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM)" for researchers to study glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor. The dataset comprises magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from three time points: preoperative, early postoperative (within 72 hours), and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis. The dataset is unique in that it only includes patients who have undergone total or near-total resection of the enhancing tumor.

The MRI scans are multiparametric, meaning they combine different types of sequences, such as structural and diffusion MRI. This allows researchers to analyze various aspects of the brain tissue. The dataset also contains clinical information, volumetric assessments of resection extents, molecular data, and survival details.

Glioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor that has a poor prognosis despite extensive research efforts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key tool for diagnosing and monitoring glioblastoma. Advanced medical image processing techniques and artificial intelligence-based algorithms can be used to analyze MRI scans and improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models.

Some key terms defined:

* Glioblastoma: a type of primary brain tumor
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a medical imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body
* Multiparametric MRI: combines different types of MRI sequences, such as structural and diffusion MRI
* Total or near-total resection: surgical removal of the majority of the tumor
* Enhancing tumor: a type of glioblastoma that appears brighter on MRI scans due to increased blood flow
* Clinical information: patient data such as age, sex, and medical history
* Volumetric assessments: measurements of the volume of resected tissue
* Molecular data: information about the genetic makeup of the tumor
* Survival details: patient outcomes, including length of survival

No mathematical functions were mentioned in this text.





#**#Background and Significance**

Glioblastoma, an aggressive primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis despite extensive research efforts. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from public repositories like The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and BraTS have contributed to the field's progress. However, these resources mainly focus on preoperative studies with diverse resection extent categories, limited expert annotations, and primarily feature structural MRI sequences. To address these limitations, this study introduces the "Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM)" containing multiparametric MRI images captured at three critical time points: preoperative, early postoperative (within 72 hours), and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis. The dataset exclusively features patients who have undergone total or near-total resection of the enhancing tumor, along with tumor subregion segmentations for each time point. Additionally, the dataset includes clinical information, volumetric assessments of resection extents, molecular data, and survival details. By publicly releasing this dataset, researchers can analyze recurrence patterns in patients with gross total or near-total resections and develop novel algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.





#**#Methods**

This section outlines the methods used in the study on WHO grade 4 astrocytoma patients who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022.

Here's a summary of the provided text:

The study population consisted of 40 patients with gross total resections (GTR) or near-total resections (NTR), confirmed histopathological diagnosis, and availability of MRI studies at three time points. Patients received adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the Stupp protocol.

Clinical and pathological information was obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and volumetric assessment of the extent of resection. MRI scans were conducted at Río Hortega University Hospital.

The images were retrieved from the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format for subsequent processing. The steps involved:

1. Converting the images to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using the dicom2niix tool.
2. Registering T1ce scans to the SRI24 anatomical atlas space using FLIRT.
3. Registering T1w, T2w, FLAIR scans, and ADC maps to the transformed T1ce scan.
4. Extracting the brain from all co-registered scans using a deep learning tool called Synthstrip included in FreeSurfer v7.3.0.
5. Performing intensity Z-scoring normalization using the normalization tools included in Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk) v1.9.0.

Finally, computeraided segmentations were generated using Deep-Medic to obtain three labels corresponding to necrosis, peritumoral signal alteration, and enhancing tumor. The segmentations were reviewed and manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons.





#**#Results**

The Results section presents a summary of demographic data for 40 patients with glioblastomas treated at the Río Hortega University Hospital. The key findings are as follows:

* Demographics:
	+ Average age: 63 ± 9 years
	+ Male-to-female ratio: 70% to 30%
	+ Median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score: 80
	+ IDH-mutated cases: 10%, IDH wild-type: 90%
* Surgical data:
	+ Gross total resection (GTR): 67.5% of patients, near-total resection (NTR): 32.5%
	+ Mean extent of resection (EOR): 99.31 ± 1.36%
* Imaging and tumor volume data:
	+ Mean preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume: 34.99 ± 26.59
	+ Mean postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor volume: 0.23 ± 0.47
	+ Mean preoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality: 73.14 ± 43.63, mean postoperative T2/FLAIR abnormality: 35.00 ± 26.74
* Survival data:
	+ Median overall survival: 364 days
	+ Median progression-free survival: 198 days

In summary, the study population consisted of mostly male patients with a median age of 63 years and a median preoperative KPS score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy. Surgical data showed that most patients underwent GTR or NTR, with a mean EOR of 99.31%. Imaging data revealed significant changes in tumor volume and signal alteration after surgery. Survival outcomes indicate median overall survival of 364 days and median progression-free survival of 198 days.

#**#Discussion**

Summary:
The discussion highlights the importance of public MRI collections for glioblastoma research, specifically emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets. The current collections mainly focus on preoperative studies and lack information on tumor resection extent or segmentations. The HURH-GBM collection is a significant addition, providing early postoperative studies, recurrence scans, expert-corrected segmentations, and patients with gross total resections.

Key points:

* Public MRI collections for glioblastoma research have limitations:
	+ Primarily focus on preoperative studies
	+ Lack information on tumor resection extent or segmentations
* Notable datasets include TCGA-GBM, CPTAC-GBM, QIN GBM, ACRIN-FMISO-Brain, and BraTS Challenge 2021
* The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection offers longitudinal studies but lacks early postoperative assessments and segmentations
* Recent datasets from UPENN-GBM and UCSF-PDGM provide expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities but have limitations, such as limited follow-up studies or preoperative-only scans
* The HURH-GBM collection addresses these limitations by incorporating:
	+ Early postoperative studies
	+ Recurrence scans
	+ Expert-corrected segmentations, particularly useful for postoperative scans
	+ Patients with gross total resections for investigating tumor recurrence patterns and ground truths for segmentation and coregistration algorithms
