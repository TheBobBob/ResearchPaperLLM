**Abstract**
Chilean peach growers have achieved worldwide recognition for their high-quality fruit products. Among the main
factors influencing peach fruit quality, sweetness is pivotal for maintaining the market’s competitiveness. Numer‑
ous studies have been conducted in different peach-segregating populations to unravel SSC regulation. However,
different cultivars may also have distinct genetic conformation, and other factors, such as environmental conditions,
can significantly impact SSC. Using a transcriptomic approach with a gene co-expression network analysis, we aimed
to identify the regulatory mechanism that controls the sugar accumulation process in an ’O × N’ peach population.
This population was previously studied through genomic analysis, associating LG5 with the genetic control of the SSC
trait. The results obtained in this study allowed us to identify 91 differentially expressed genes located on chromo‑
some 5 of the peach genome as putative new regulators of sugar accumulation in peach, together with a regulatory
network that involves genes directly associated with sugar transport (PpSWEET15), cellulose biosynthesis (PpCSLG2),
flavonoid biosynthesis (PpPAL1), pectin modifications (PpPG, PpPL and PpPMEi), expansins (PpEXPA1 and PpEXPA8)
and several transcription factors (PpC3H67, PpHB7, PpRVE1 and PpCBF4) involved with the SSC phenotype. These results
contribute to a better understanding of the genetic control of the SSC trait for future breeding programs in peaches.

**Introduction**
The Chilean fresh fruit export industry has achieved
worldwide recognition for its high-quality fruit products, particularly grapes, apples, tomatoes, cherries,
and peaches. In peach production, 302,578 tons of
Chilean fresh peaches and nectarines were reported to
be produced in 2021 [6]. Sweetness is a pivotal attribute
among the myriad factors influencing fruit quality. The
quantification of sweetness in fruit is fundamentally
grounded in the soluble solids content (SSC), which
encompasses all soluble substances within the fruit,
primarily sugars [20]. Achieving optimal sweetness levels, which entail a harmonious balance between sugars,
acids, and other chemical components, has become a




**Conclusion**
The study utilizing the ‘O × N’ peach population to
identify the regulatory mechanisms of soluble solids
content (SSC) builds upon previous genomic studies that identified a consistent QTL for SSC on chromosome 5 of the peach genome. Our transcriptomic
analysis of SSC traits in ‘O × N’ contrasting individuals
led to identifying 91 DEGs as potential SSC regulatory
candidate genes, colocalizing with the aforementioned
QTLs. Additionally, a gene co-expression network
analysis using the ConnecTF transcription factor-target


-----

gene interaction (TF-TG) database identified 629 DEGs
as candidates associated with SSC regulation.
In HighSSC individuals, there was an overrepresentation of genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis,
sugar accumulation, cellulose biosynthesis, and pectin
modification. Conversely, LowSSC individuals showed
a greater representation of genes related to photosynthesis, the ethylene pathway, and hemicellulose disassembly processes. These findings suggest distinct
molecular pathways contributing to the SSC phenotype
in peaches. The implications of these results for peach
production and breeding are significant. By identifying and validating several candidate genes for the
SSC phenotype in contrasting peach varieties through
RT-qPCR, such as PpSWEET15, PpCSLG2, PpPAL1,
PpRVE1, and PpCBF4, we provide valuable genetic targets for future breeding programs aimed at improving
fruit quality. These genes can be utilized as molecular
markers to select for peach varieties with enhanced
sweetness, thereby increasing the competitiveness of
Chilean peach growers in the global market. Moreover,
understanding the regulatory networks controlling SSC
can aid in developing strategies to manipulate these
pathways, producing consistently high-quality peaches
under varying environmental conditions.
In summary, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic control of SSC in peaches, offering practical applications for breeding programs focused
on fruit quality improvement.

#Discussion


**Discussion**
The ’O × N’ peach population used in this research for
transcriptomic analysis was evaluated for 3 years for different fruit quality traits, including soluble solids content

[21]. During the 2015–2017 seasons, the ’O × N’ population was segregated for the SSC trait, with values between
8 and 25°Brix. It has been reported that fruit sugar accumulation is highly affected by other fruit developmental
phenotypes such as pubescence, flesh color development,
or maturity date. The selection of ’O × N’ individuals
was carried out considering that the phenotypic classes
(LowSSC and HighSSC) did not have significant differences for these traits (Additional file 2: Table S2).
However, in the ’O × N’ population, it was impossible to
identify a substantial number of nectarines individuals
with low SSC or peaches with high SSC. This relationship
between fruit pubescence and soluble solids content has
been previously described in peaches [23]. This is probably because the genomic regions that control both traits
are very close in the peach genome.


-----

In previous research, the SSC phenotype in the ’O × N’
population was associated with linkage group 5 of the
peach genome through QTL analysis (Pp05:12,106,999–
18,240,259). Interestingly, the results obtained by [21]
show that the identified QTL for SSC colocalizes with
the morphological marker for the glabrous trait (peach/
nectarine), which explains why it was not possible to
separate these phenotypes in the selection of individuals for transcriptomic analysis. Additionally, the parents ’O’Henry’ and NR-053 genomes were previously
sequenced. A variant detection analysis identified five
candidate genes (colocated with the QTL for SSC) with
nonsynonymous DNA variations that could explain the
differences in sugar accumulation observed in the ’O × N’
population. One was described as a probable polygalacturonase (PpPG), one as a sucrose synthase 6 (PpSUS6),
and three annotated as transcription factors (PpbHLH14,
_PpMYB98, and PpMADS6)._
According to the differential expression analysis
between samples with contrasting SSC phenotypes performed in this research, we postulate that the 12 DEGs
shown in Table 1 that colocalize with the QTL for SSC
in the ’O × N’ population could be added to the group of
possible regulatory genes of the SSC phenotype along
with the transcription factors PpbHLH14, PpMYB98 and
_PpMADS6 described in Nuñez-Lillo et al. [21]. However,_
more analyses are necessary to corroborate the participation of any of these candidate genes in the regulation of
sugar accumulation in peach trees.
On the other hand, the three transcription factors
with information in the ConnecTF database highly
expressed in HighSSC individuals used to construct
the SSC regulatory network shown in Fig. 2 are located
on chromosomes Pp02 (PpHB7), Pp03 (PpRVE1) and
Pp05 (PpC3H67) of the peach genome. The only gene
colocalizing with the QTL for SSC in the ’O × N’ population was the transcription factor _PpC3H67, located at_
Pp05:14,060,293.14,065,599. Therefore, it is one of the
most robust candidates for regulating the SSC trait in
peach, although no functional information about this
transcription factor has been published.
Figure 2 shows higher expression values of sugar accumulation-related genes (PpSWEET1 and _PpSWEET15)_
identified in samples with high SSC phenotypes. These
genes are bidirectional membrane transporters that
facilitate sugar transport along a concentration gradient and are involved in different cellular processes, such
as pollen nutrition, nectar secretion, seed-filling plantpathogen interactions, abiotic stress responses, and fruit
development [12]. In particular, it has been reported that
_MdSWEET15, together with_ _MdSWEET9, participates_
in the sugar accumulation process in apples during fruit
development [32], while in tomatoes, it has been reported


that SlSWEET1, -2, -7, and -14 are involved in the early
stage of the sugar accumulation process and that their
expression decreases with maturation [7]. Ko et al. [13]
confirmed that SlSWEET15 mediates apoplastic sucrose
unloading from the phloem for carbon supply during
fruit expansion and development, associating it with the
control of sucrose accumulation in the fruit. Although
one SWEET gene (PpSWEET17) was also detected in
LowSSC individuals (Fig. 2), the expression levels of this
gene are considerably lower than those of the SWEET
genes identified in HighSSC individuals (approximately
10 times greater for _PpSWEET1 and_ _PpSWEET15 than_
for _PpSWEET17). Furthermore, as shown in Fig._ 3, the
correlation of the _PpSWEET15 gene expression val-_
ues in peach varieties with contrasting SSC phenotypes
was evaluated (showing a correlation of 0.96), validating
its relationship with peach sugar accumulation. Finally,
for these reasons, we believe that _PpSWEET15 and_
_PpSWEET1 could be responsible for the observed differ-_
ences in the SSC trait in peach trees.
On the other hand, many genes related to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and the cell wall remodeling
process were also associated with HighSSC individuals,
suggesting a correlation between these processes and the
SSC trait in the ’O × N’ population. These correlations
were evaluated in contrasting SSC peach varieties using
selected candidate genes (PpPAL1 for flavonoid accumulation and PpCSLG2 for cell wall remodeling). Both candidates showed strong correlations with the SSC trait in
peach varieties (Fig. 3), demonstrating that there is a correlation between the SSC phenotype and the biosynthesis
of flavonoids and cellulose in peach fruit varieties and not
only in the ’O × N’ segregating population. Similar results
were reported by García-Gómez et al. [8] in apricot (Pru_nus armeniaca L.), flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes_
were identified differentially expressed between genotypes with contrasting SSC phenotype, among which
are mentioned the _PAL,_ _C4H,_ _4CL, and_ _DFR. However,_
the regulatory mechanisms that control these correlations are still unknown, and more in-depth analyses are
needed to corroborate these findings.
