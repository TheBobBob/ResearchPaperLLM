#Summary

The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma dataset aims to address the limitations of existing MRI repositories by providing a comprehensive collection of multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images from patients with glioblastoma who have undergone total or near-total resection. The dataset includes preoperative, early postoperative (within 72 hours), and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis, along with tumor subregion segmentations for each time point. By publicly disseminating this dataset, the authors aim to enable researchers to investigate recurrence patterns in patients with gross total or near-total resection and develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.


#Background and Significance

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts. The integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based algorithms has improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key data source in this domain, with public repositories like TCIA and BraTS providing valuable datasets for research.

However, these public resources have limitations, focusing primarily on preoperative studies with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited expert annotations. To address these constraints, the Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is introduced, featuring multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis.

The significance of this study lies in its ability to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. By publicly disseminating this dataset, researchers can develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.


#Methods

• The study used MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to acquire data from glioblastoma patients.

• The MRI acquisition parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 1, which includes information on the manufacturer, model, and field strength of the MRI machines, as well as the number of studies acquired at each center.

• The MRI sequences used were:
	+ T1ce (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted): TR/TE = 7.98 ms/2.57 ms; 3D; GRE; matrix = 512 x 512; slice thickness = 1 mm.
	+ T1w (T1-weighted): TR/TE = 580 ms/7.56 ms; 2D; FSE; matrix = 512 x 512; slice thickness = 5 mm.
	+ T2w (T2-weighted): TR/TE = 5220 ms/96.12 ms; 2D; FRSE; matrix = 512 x 512; slice thickness = 5 mm.
	+ FLAIR (Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery): TR/TE = 8002 ms/135.07 ms; 2D; FSE; matrix = 512 x 512; slice thickness = 4 mm.
	+ DWI (Diffusion weighted imaging): TR/TE = 8000 ms/111.7 ms; matrix = 128 x 160; slice thickness = 5 mm; b-values = 0 and 1000 s/mm2.

• The study did not provide information on the experimental design, procedures, or materials used beyond the MRI acquisition parameters.


#Results

The study population consisted of 40 patients with glioblastomas, with an average age of 63 ± 9 years and a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy.

Key findings:

• **Demographics**: 70% of patients were men, and 30% were women; median age was 63 ± 9 years.
• **IDH status**: 10% of patients had IDH-mutated glioblastomas, while 90% were IDH wild-type.
• **Surgical outcomes**:
	+ Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 67.5% of patients.
	+ Near-total resection (NTR) was achieved in 32.5% of patients.
	+ Mean extent of resection (EOR) was 99.31 ± 1.36%.
• **Survival outcomes**:
	+ Median overall survival was 364 days.
	+ Median progression-free survival was 198 days.

These findings provide insights into the characteristics and treatment outcomes for patients with glioblastomas, which can inform future research and clinical practice.


#Discussion

The discussion highlights the limitations of existing public MRI collections for glioblastoma research, specifically the lack of early postoperative studies and tumor segmentations. The authors emphasize the importance of including these features to facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns and improve segmentation algorithms.

The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection is noted as a valuable resource, but its limitations are also discussed. The recent UPENN-GBM and UCSF-PDGM collections are highlighted for their inclusion of expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities, but they too have limitations.

The HURH-GBM collection is presented as an enhancement to the existing resources, providing early postoperative studies, recurrence scans, and expert-corrected segmentations. This dataset has the potential to facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns and serve as a ground truth for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.

Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of including early postoperative studies and tumor segmentations in public MRI collections to advance glioblastoma research.
