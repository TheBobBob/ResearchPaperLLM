#Summary

The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is a publicly available dataset that aims to improve glioblastoma research by providing multiparametric MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. The dataset features expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions, offering valuable ground truth data for developing algorithms for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans. By analyzing this dataset, researchers can study recurrence patterns and develop new diagnostic and prognostic models, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective treatments for glioblastoma patients.


#Background and Significance

Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts. The integration of advanced medical image processing techniques with artificial intelligence-based algorithms has improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial data source in this domain, with public repositories like TCIA and BraTS providing valuable datasets for research.

However, these resources have limitations, focusing primarily on preoperative studies with diverse tumor extent of resection (EOR) categories and limited expert annotations. To address these constraints, the Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is introduced, featuring multiparametric structural and diffusion MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations upon recurrence diagnosis.

The significance of this study lies in its ability to enable the scientific community to scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. By publicly disseminating this dataset, researchers can develop novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.


#Methods

This study retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022 with a confirmed histopathological diagnosis of WHO grade 4 astrocytoma. The inclusion criteria were: gross total resections (GTR) or near-total resections (NTR), availability of MRI studies at three time points, and receipt of adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the Stupp protocol.

The study population consisted of 40 patients who met these criteria. Clinical and pathological information was obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, use of operative adjuncts, volumetric assessment of the extent of resection, presence of postoperative neurological deficits, details of chemotherapy and radiotherapy received, and overall survival and progression-free survival times.

The MRI scans were conducted at Río Hortega University Hospital. The images were retrieved from the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format for subsequent processing. The images were converted to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using the dicom2niix tool.

The T1ce scans for each subject were registered to the SRI24 anatomical atlas space using the FLIRT (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool). The T1w, T2w, FLAIR scans, and ADC maps were then registered to the transformed T1ce scan. The brain was extracted from all co-registered scans using a deep learning tool called Synthstrip.

Intensity Z-scoring normalization was performed using the normalization tools included in Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk).

The preprocessed images from each time point were used as input for generating computer-aided segmentations using Deep-Medic. Three labels were subsequently obtained, corresponding to necrosis, peritumoral signal alteration, and enhancing tumor. All segmentations were carefully reviewed and manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons.

Overall, the study employed a combination of image processing techniques, including registration, normalization, and segmentation, to analyze MRI scans from patients with WHO grade 4 astrocytoma.


#Results

The study population consisted of 40 patients with glioblastoma, with a mean age of 63 years (±9) and a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The majority (95%) had de novo glioblastomas, while 5% had recurrent tumors previously treated with standard chemoradiotherapy.

The study found that the mean preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume was 34.99 ± 26.59, and the mean postoperative residual tumor volume was 0.23 ± 0.47. The median overall survival was 364 days, and the median progression-free survival was 198 days.

In terms of surgical outcomes, 67.5% of patients underwent gross total resection (GTR), while 32.5% had near-total resection (NTR). The mean extent of resection (EOR) was 99.31 ± 1.36%.

The study also reported on the use of various operative adjuncts, including 5-aminolevulinic acid (5’ALA), sodium fluorescein, neuronavigation, intraoperative ultrasound (IoUS), and image-guided navigation (IONM). Additionally, the study noted that 72.5% of patients received radiotherapy treatment with VMAT-IMRT-IGRT at a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions.

In terms of postoperative outcomes, 65% of patients did not experience any neurological deficit, while 15% had transient deficits and 15% had minor persistent deficits. Only 5% of patients experienced major persistent deficits.


#Discussion

The current public MRI collections for glioblastoma patients have contributed significantly to advancements in the field, but they primarily focus on preoperative studies and lack information on tumor resection extent. The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection offers longitudinal studies, but it lacks early postoperative assessments and segmentations. Recent datasets from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPENN-GBM) and The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI (UCSF-PDGM) provide expert-refined segmentations and additional modalities, but they have limitations in terms of follow-up studies and early postoperative scans.

The HURH-GBM collection addresses these limitations by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans. The inclusion of patients with gross total resection may facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns, and the provided labels can serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.
