#Summary

The study reveals that different wild-type zebrafish lines reared in identical conditions exhibit distinct differences in development and reproduction, posing concerns about research reproducibility. The significance of this finding lies in the fact that many studies do not specify the zebrafish line used or its origin, which can impact the generalizability of results. To address this issue, researchers must deliberately choose a specific line based on an understanding of its characteristics and genetic/phenotypic variations.

#Discussion

The discussion section highlights the findings from comparing key parameters related to growth, stress response, and reproduction in four commonly used WT zebrafish lines bred under the same laboratory conditions. The study found that cortisol levels were similar among the four tested lines, suggesting that the level of stress hormones in zebrafish is robust to different domestication routes applied. Additionally, equivalent serotonin brain levels between two specific lines (AB and TU) were confirmed.

The comparison of growth and puberty timing revealed differences among the AB, SJD, TU, and WIK lines, with the AB and SJD lines showing distinct patterns. These findings may be attributed to the different processes of adaptation to laboratory conditions that each line has undergone.

Overall, this study suggests that the choice of zebrafish line is not a key parameter impacting the results for endocrine evaluation of basal stress in zebrafish. The short life cycle of zebrafish, which allows them to mature at approximately 3 months of age, makes them an increasingly popular animal model for research.
